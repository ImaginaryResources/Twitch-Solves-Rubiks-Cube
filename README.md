# Twitch Solves Rubik's Cube
A program that reads twitch chat messages and sends them as keyboard presses to control the Rubikâ€™s cube [here](https://www.google.com/logos/2014/rubiks/iframe/index.html)

This project's objective is to bring the Speed Cubing Community closer together by having a place to chat and solve the cube together
